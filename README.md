Crowdfunding ETL Project

This repository contains a data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) project focused on crowdfunding data. The project is a collaboration between Mahalel Peter and Harshh Patel, aiming to build an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions.

Project Overview:

Category and Subcategory DataFrames: Extracts category and subcategory data from crowdfunding.xlsx and saves it as CSV files.

Campaign DataFrame: Extracts campaign data from crowdfunding.xlsx, transforms it, and exports it as a CSV file.

Contacts DataFrame: Extracts contact information from contacts.xlsx, transforms it, and exports it as a CSV file.

Crowdfunding Database: Designs and creates a PostgreSQL database schema based on the extracted data. CSV files are then imported into the corresponding tables.

Project Execution:

Please refer to the detailed instructions provided in the project documentation for step-by-step guidance on executing each part of the project.

Ensure all files and instructions are comprehensively documented in your GitHub repository.
